# Spring Boot CRUD REST API - USER Management System

## Project Overview
The **Spring Boot CRUD REST API - USER Management System** is a comprehensive project that demonstrates the development of a User Management System using Spring Boot and RESTful APIs. This application is designed to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on user data while interacting with a MySQL database. Below is a detailed breakdown of the project's features and setup instructions.

## Project Setup

### Create and Setup Spring Boot Project in IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open  Spring Boot Tool Suite and create a new Spring Boot project.
2. Select necessary dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL Driver.
3. Set up the project structure and configuration files.

## Key Features
- **Create Employee JPA Entity**: Definition of the Employee JPA entity to model the user data.
- **Create EmployeeRepository**: Development of a repository interface to handle CRUD operations for the Employee entity.
- **Create EmployeeDto and EmployeeMapper**: Implementation of Data Transfer Object (DTO) and Mapper to facilitate data transfer and transformation between layers.
- **Build Add Employee REST API**: Construction of a RESTful API endpoint to add new employees to the system.
- **Build Get Employee REST API**: Creation of a RESTful API endpoint to retrieve details of a specific employee by ID.
- **Build Get All Employees REST API**: Development of a RESTful API endpoint to fetch a list of all employees.
- **Build Update Employee REST API**: Building of a RESTful API endpoint to update existing employee details.
- **Build Delete Employee REST API**: Creation of a RESTful API endpoint to delete an employee from the system.

## Summary
This project serves as a practical guide to building a user management system with Spring Boot. It covers the entire process from project setup and database configuration to creating and managing RESTful APIs. By following this project, developers can learn how to efficiently handle CRUD operations, data persistence, and RESTful service creation in a Spring Boot application.
